# Project-5-LeNet-5-Convolutional-Neural-Network-is-Used-to-Recognize-Handwritten-Digits.
Convolutional neural networks have achieved great success in computer vision and have many industrial and commercial applications. One of the most typical commercial applications is the LeNet5 neural network that recognizes handwritten numbers on checks. Although the LeNet5 network is small, it contains the basic modules of deep learning: the convolutional layer, the pooling layer, and the full connection layer, which are the basis of other deep learning models.
